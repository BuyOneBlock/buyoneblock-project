# Holding Governance — Strategic Control & Compliance

## 1. Purpose of the Holding

The Buy One Block Holding is the central governance entity that:

- manages all company funds and assets,
- controls all real-estate investments,
- oversees all utilities and token-based access,
- ensures full legal and operational compliance.

This structure guarantees long-term stability and protects the ecosystem from speculative or unregulated behavior.

## 2. Token Utility vs. Ownership

The 1BONEBU token is a **utility token**, not a share or financial instrument.

- Token holders do **not** own company assets.
- Token holders do **not** participate in governance or decision-making.
- Token holders receive **access** to opportunities created and managed by the holding.

This model ensures compliance with international regulations and avoids any misrepresentation of financial rights.

---

## 3. Investment Control

All investments — including real-estate acquisitions, partnerships, and strategic deployments — are:

- initiated,
- managed,
- and owned

**exclusively by the holding**.

Token holders may gain access to these opportunities, but never control or own them.

## 4. Compliance & Risk Mitigation

The holding structure is designed to:

- avoid securities classification,
- prevent legal exposure for token holders,

## 5. Access Criteria

Access to holding-managed opportunities depends on:

- token amount held,

Eligibility is determined by the holding and may evolve over time.
