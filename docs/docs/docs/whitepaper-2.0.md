# 📙 Whitepaper 2.0 — Real‑Estate Access & Holding Governance

## 1. Introduction

Whitepaper 2.0 introduces the real‑world dimension of Buy One Block.  
The token evolves from a digital utility to a **gateway to exclusive opportunities** created by the holding and the affiliated real‑estate company.

## 2. Why the Holding Controls Investments

To ensure compliance, stability, and full strategic control:

👉 **Only the holding invests, manages funds, and owns assets.**  
👉 **Token holders receive access to the opportunities generated by these investments.**

This model:

- protects the company,  
- avoids regulatory risks,  
- ensures long‑term governance,  
- maintains full operational power,  
- delivers real utility without transferring ownership.

## 3. Real‑Estate Access (Phase 2.0)

Through the affiliated real‑estate company, token holders gain access to:

- private real‑estate investment opportunities,  
- premium member‑only projects,  
- preferential conditions,  
- VIP real‑estate events,  
- exclusive briefings and opportunities validated by the holding.

These opportunities are **not available to the public**.

## 4. Hybrid Model: Web3 + Real Estate

Phase 2.0 merges:

- Web3 utility (Phase 1.0)  
- Real‑estate access (Phase 2.0)

This creates a unique hybrid ecosystem where:

- real‑world opportunities,  
- and long‑term value
