# 1. Utility Model Overview

The 1BONEBU token is a **utility token** designed to provide **access**, not ownership.  
It does not represent a share, a financial instrument, or a direct investment.

Instead:

👉 **The Buy One Block Holding manages all company funds, utilities, and investments**,  
and  
👉 **token holders receive privileged access to the opportunities created by this structure**.

This ensures:

- full strategic control remains with the holding,  
- regulatory compliance,  
- protection of the company,  
- long‑term stability,  
- real, durable, non‑speculative utility for holders.

Token holders do **not** own assets.  
They gain **exclusive access** to the benefits generated by the holding’s activities.

# 2. Phase 1.0 — Web3 Utilities

Phase 1.0 establishes the digital utility layer of the ecosystem.

Holders gain access to:

- early access to new features,  
- reduced fees and premium tools,  
- private programs (whitelists, pre‑launches),  
- exclusive documents, analysis, and resources,  
- VIP status based on holding amount and duration.

These utilities reflect the foundation described on the website and in Whitepaper 1.0:  
**a transparent, ethical, access‑driven Web3 ecosystem.**

# 3. Phase 2.0 — Real‑Estate Access via the Holding

Phase 2.0 introduces the real‑world dimension of Buy One Block.

- exclusive briefings validated by the holding.

These opportunities are created and controlled **entirely by the holding**, ensuring:

Token holders do **not** participate in investments.  
They receive **access** to the advantages generated by the holding’s investments.

- the ability to offer premium utilities without transferring ownership.

This is the core message of the website and Whitepaper 2.0:
