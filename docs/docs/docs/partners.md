# 🤝 Partnerships — Buy One Block

This document outlines how Buy One Block selects, structures, and manages partnerships in full alignment with Whitepaper 1.0 (Web3 foundation) and Whitepaper 2.0 (Real‑estate access & Holding governance).

## 🔹 Role of the Holding in Utilities & Investments

The utility of the 1BONEBU token is built on a structured model where:

👉 **the Buy One Block Holding manages all company funds, utilities, and investments**,  
and  
👉 **token holders receive privileged access to the opportunities created by this structure**.

This model ensures:

- full decision‑making power remains with the holding,  
- regulatory compliance,  
- protection of the company and its assets,  
- operational stability,  
- real, durable, non‑speculative utility for holders.

Token holders do **not** become owners of the assets.  
Instead, they receive **exclusive access to benefits generated by the investments made by the holding and the affiliated real‑estate company**.

## 🔹 Our Partnership Philosophy

Buy One Block is built on four core principles:

- **Long‑term vision** — We prioritize durable, meaningful, value‑driven relationships.  
- **Transparency** — Clear communication, defined deliverables, documented commitments.  
- **Real utility** — Every partnership must create tangible value for token holders.  
- **Ethics** — No speculative collaborations, no misleading operations.

We choose **fewer partners, but better aligned**, with genuine strategic impact.

## 🔹 Token Utility (Phase 1.0)

The 1BONEBU token is **not** a financial instrument.  
Its utility is based on a compliant and controlled model where:

👉 **the Buy One Block Holding manages all funds, utilities, and company investments**,  
ensuring strong governance and full operational control.

Token holders receive privileged access to ecosystem utilities without ever becoming owners of the company’s assets.

This model protects Buy One Block, ensures compliance, and enables premium utilities without transferring financial rights.

---

## 🔹 Real‑Estate Access & Utilities via the Holding (Phase 2.0)

In Phase 2.0, the token’s utility evolves:  
holders gain exclusive access to opportunities created by:

- **the Buy One Block Holding**,  
- **the affiliated real‑estate company**.

The holding retains **full authority** over funds, investments, and strategic decisions.  
Token holders do **not** participate in investments; instead:

👉 they receive **privileged access to utilities and benefits generated by these investments**.

This hybrid model ensures:

- full regulatory compliance,  
- legal and operational stability,  
- protection of the company,  
- real, durable, non‑speculative utility for holders.

# 🧩 Phase 2.0 — Partnerships with the Holding & Real‑Estate Company

Phase 2.0 introduces a unique model:  
👉 **token utilities are delivered through the Buy One Block Holding and the affiliated real‑estate company**.

This creates a bridge between:

- Web3 utility (Phase 1.0),  
- exclusive real‑estate access (Phase 2.0),  
- the holding structure (governance, stability, compliance).

### 🏢 Real‑Estate Partnerships  
Selected real‑estate partners will enable token holders to access:

- **private investment opportunities not available to the public**,  
- **premium member‑only projects**,  
- **preferential conditions**,  
- **VIP real‑estate events**,  
- **opportunities validated and supervised by the holding**.

### 🏛️ Holding‑Level Partnerships  
The Buy One Block Holding oversees:

- VIP programs,  
- premium utilities,  
- cross‑benefits (digital + real‑estate),  
- compliance and governance,  
- long‑term sustainability of commitments.
