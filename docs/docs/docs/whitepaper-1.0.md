# 📘 Whitepaper 1.0 — Web3 Foundation & Utility Token

## 1. Introduction

Buy One Block is built on a clear and transparent mission:

## 2. The 1BONEBU Utility Token

The 1BONEBU token is a **utility token** designed to provide access — not ownership, not profit sharing, and not financial returns.

It reflects the core principles displayed on our website:

- transparency,  
- long‑term vision,  
- real utility,  
- ethical structure.

### What the token provides
- Access to Buy One Block features  
- Reduced fees and premium tools  
- Early access to new releases  
- Private programs (whitelists, pre‑launches)  
- Exclusive documents and resources  
- VIP status based on holding and duration

The token is the **digital access layer** of the ecosystem.

## 3. Role of the Holding (Phase 1.0)

As stated on our website, Buy One Block operates under a strong governance structure.

👉 **The Buy One Block Holding manages all company funds, utilities, and investments.**

This ensures:

- full control and decision‑making power,  
- regulatory compliance,  
- protection of the company,  
- operational stability,  
- a safe and durable model for token holders.

Token holders do **not** own company assets.  
They receive **access** to utilities created by the holding.

## 4. Ethical & Transparent Framework

Buy One Block commits to:

- no unrealistic promises,  
- no speculative mechanisms,  
- no misleading communication,  
- clear and documented deliverables.

Whitepaper 1.0 reflects the same values communicated on our website:  
**clarity, ethics, and long‑term value creation.**
